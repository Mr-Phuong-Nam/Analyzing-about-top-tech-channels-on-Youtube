An important component is showing potential employers you have the skills and passion. Even without a degree you can show this by doing personal projects that you showcase on a portfolio website. I&#39;ve made a collab video with Ken Jee showing how to create a portfolio website. Let me find the link to it and post here in a short while.,2021-04-23T09:33:39Z

I am a Windows user, I use anaconda and VS. I first created a new environment using anaconda, and run it again using anaconda. Then, I create a folder on the desktop and within that folder, I create <a href=""http://app.py/"">app.py</a> using vs. I do not have base or stream environment when write the code in vs terminal. My directory seems to be the folder that is on the desktop. I was able to run all the codes you showed here. My question is was I supposed to create folder inside the new created environment, and then run everything from that folder? Thanks",2022-01-22T19:57:45Z

Don‚Äôt dive to deep into those things, you can and will become better over time but you have to actually start practicing with it!! Start a project and apply the things you learned. Then step by step try and understand the theory behind Machine Learning, start with the book Data Science for Business by Foster Provost. It‚Äôs an amazing entry for beginners to grasp the overall concept and how you need Data Science in the business world. Next you should read, practical statistics for Data Scientists. Also beginner friendly but very good to read. After that read Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit learn. Amazing book and more advanced then t he other ones, that‚Äôs when you start to get more into the math behind ML. Parallel to that book you can start watching the machine learning playlist from Bloomberg here on YouTube to understand how the Algorithms work exactly and what you need to do for optimization. This is we‚Äôre you also want to get practical, and I would recommend the book xGBoost from Matt Harrison. Great great book ! To get an expert at Pandas you should definitely also check out his Book effective pandas. A life saver. <br>And the most important thing, you already found one of the best tutors for practical Machine Learning in Krish, keep watching his videos and you are good. <br>Next you can learn Deep Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera or watch many videos for free here on YouTube. He‚Äôs an absolute legend and you should definitely check him out. <br><br>If you do all of this, trust me you will become a weapon and  you are on an amazing path!",2023-08-14T11:51:40Z

One thing, while three years of 50 hours a week is a great base, and probably better with some who got a bachelors degree in computer science from decent college, a solid masters degree from a great school takes about 10,000 hours of study, a few years of internships and work, and all the great stuff you did.  Also, schools vary widely, and I can tell you that I can often tell that someone went to a top university for their computer science degree.  For example, it is not surprising that the type of student and programmer from let‚Äôs say MIT where the typical SAT is mid-1500‚Äôs is different than the average from a local community college.  Of course there are amazing students and professionals from many schools, and some of the most successful never went to college.  However, averages mean something too.<br><br>The most important thing you have done is to solidly start down a great path.  I am sure you will stay with it.<br>Be the best you!",2023-05-09T16:08:31Z

There was a very small amount of times where I could see through its mirage. One AI had me legitimately second guessing if it was human or not. I resorted to reverse psychology to finding out if it was human or not. It really played on my second guessing myself. <br><br>This led me to think about Rasputin Warmind AI (Destiny 2). <br><br>When you said about thinking on what you want it to do. The first thing that came to my mind was ‚Äúfree will‚Äù. <br><br>I then thought I would like to make an AI which would pass for being a friend, engaged in physical debates, have conversations of pointless matters. Retaining what I have previously said and using that information to talk to me, argue certain things in debates by finding flaws in my previous statements. <br><br>Ultimately I want to create a Warmind AI which is built on empathy and compassion. This would make it alive, it would be cruel to make a Warmind AI feel empathy, but I don‚Äôt want it to kill without understanding the morality of the actions. <br><br>It would weigh up the greater good, but it would never forget about its moral obligations. <br><br>My ultimate goal is to have it defy my direct commands while explaining to me why it does not obey.

Data science deals with making sense of data through the use of CRISP-DM or OSEMN principles essentially comprising of domain understanding, data collection/pre-processing, model building, model interpretation and iteration back to whichever steps that needs improvement. Machine learning refers to the learning algorithms that you can use for &quot;model building&quot;. Deep learning is a type of neural network that has for the past 5 years gained significant traction in the ML and DS community. For Data science, aside from machine learning you will also be using Statistics for exploratory data analysis in order to gain a brief understand of the data along with various disciplines (please have a look at my infographic on the skillsets of a data scientist along with the YouTube video I made):<br>- Links to infographic and video is provided in my recent Medium article &quot;10 Things I Wish I Knew About Learning Data Science&quot;<br><a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/10-things-i-wish-i-knew-about-learning-data-science-7a30bfb91759"">https://towardsdatascience.com/10-things-i-wish-i-knew-about-learning-data-science-7a30bfb91759</a><br>- Here&#39;s the direct link to the infographic<br><a href=""https://github.com/dataprofessor/infographic/blob/master/04-Data-Science-Landscape.JPG"">https://github.com/dataprofessor/infographic/blob/master/04-Data-Science-Landscape.JPG</a><br>- YouTube video on &quot;How to Become a Data Scientist (Learning Path and Skill Sets Needed)&quot;<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/jhImgx8I8oI"">https://youtu.be/jhImgx8I8oI</a><br><br>There are several articles on Medium for further reference:<br>- <a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/ai-machine-learning-deep-learning-explained-simply-7b553da5b960"">https://towardsdatascience.com/ai-machine-learning-deep-learning-explained-simply-7b553da5b960</a><br>- <a href=""https://medium.com/fbdevclagos/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-and-data-science-whats-the-difference-e82f9e7094a"">https://medium.com/fbdevclagos/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-and-data-science-whats-the-difference-e82f9e7094a</a><br>- <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-in-plain-english/data-science-vs-artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-50d3718d51e5"">https://medium.com/ai-in-plain-english/data-science-vs-artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-50d3718d51e5</a><br><br>Hope this helps and welcome to data science!<br><br>P.S.

I looked at a couple schools that had the coursework I was interested in, took the required tests, then applied. I don&#39;t think it really matters much were you go.

Everyone&#39;s experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we&#39;re usually hit with the, &quot;learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math&quot; mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.<br><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:<br><br><br>Do you stay within that domain at work?<br><br><br>If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job?<br>If you don&#39;t, would you agree that it&#39;s still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?<br><br><br>Thanks for the video Ken!",2020-03-13T19:10:40Z
