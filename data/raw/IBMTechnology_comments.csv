Yes generators learn to map random input vectors to fake flowers without any prior knowledge of how flowers generally look, however one can use a pretrained encoder from Image encoder and decoder neural network that has been trained to encode and decode flower images. This way the generator would have some prior knowledge on where to look in a given input of random vector to generate flowers thus making the convergence faster<br><br>2. In GANs just like how we pass on random input vector, while converting text to images, one can make use of an encoder network to map the input text into embeddings (something that&#39;s called word embeddings in the NLP domain). Now these embeddings can be passed to GANs inplace of the random input vector. But in this case the descriminator has to have knowledge to perform multi-class classification, as text-to-images might involve generating multiple objects/entities unlike in GANs alone where we try to generate only one particular entity like flowers, or faces or cats etc",2023-02-12T06:05:12Z

The new tech comes a roaring like a lion. Great work on achieving but why did Watson not do the same considering it won jeopardy more than a decade ago and project debater. Wow that was revolutionary. The transparency of all these models are datasets we choose. Maybe ensuring that all models met a strict criteria. Hence auditing I guess.  I have heard alot of concern from people and tend to agree with these legitimized concerns. It should be able to do what Watson did and not produce an answer till it is ready to run. Watching the jeopardy challenge was an eye opener. Based on percentage an answer was given. Or not at all. That was a good solution. Keep it up and open folks we all need to have the talk. This is new and what we lack is the experience. Sad but aging seems that way too. Just the way of the world I tend to observe. It‚Äôs time that will tell this story. Hope we can get it right.

So even things like the shift in word use frequency when ingesting the Google books corpus are problematic.  As are the attitudes towards other sexes and races, etc... In those writings.  Watson did well on the game show, but didn&#39;t do so hot at their other hopes for it.  It largely failed to make headway on biomedical problems and pharmaceuticals and was unable to generate the profit IBM had hoped it might.  The people that work in these domains understand how their data works and the potential for sophisticated models to fail in actual application, hence why linear modeling is still so common for them.  It isn&#39;t just them being Luddites or dinosaurs, it&#39;s that it isn&#39;t their rodeo.  They&#39;ve been through building sophisticated models and watching them fail to improve real diagnosis rates on new incoming patients because they have more systemic but shifting (non-stationary) differences in their mean and standard deviation, etc... that the models spuriously relied on.  I see the same thing all the time now.  It goes like this: <br>1) They gather a nice curated data set<br>2) They split into test and train<br>3) They use train to build the model, test on test and results are great, seems like it generalizes to test data.  They say, &quot;let&#39;s use this for real in the clinic!&quot;<br>4) They try it in the clinic and results are not necessarily awful,... but they&#39;re below the benchmark heuristic or standard measure previously in use.  The new data is messier and had systemic differences from the training/testing data, and again, these characteristics drift over time, so the longer they try to keep it going in the clinic, the worse things seem to get.  <br>5) The publish that good part from before they went to the real world use case and the real case is a failure so they don&#39;t even try to publish it.  People get more hyped and gassed up on the sophisticated new methods.  <br>6) Eventually people become disillusioned, but not until failing themselves.  In the macro scale you get things like the &quot;AI Winter.&quot;  <br><br>It&#39;s difficult to scrutinize the model data because it&#39;s so large.

Of course, you can assign it, explain to students what the purpose of the class (and the assignment) is, and hope they use the assignment as an opportunity to learn. However, at this point, the real question is what the purpose of learning is. <br><br>If AI is intelligent enough to write the essay (and actively apply that knowledge in the field by the time the student graduates), then perhaps it&#39;s the wrong assignment. <br><br>An argument could be made, in some instances, that the subject is still important to learn, but at what point are you teaching something that&#39;s no longer relevant to the job. When does a student feel redundant, hopelessly trying compete with an AI that is (potentially) advancing exponentially and can multiply infinitely? <br><br>There&#39;s a real crisis of purpose. It&#39;s hard enough for students to choose a career path and remain motivated to follow through, even when that career path is 99% certain. <br><br>But what happens when there&#39;s a 50% chance or higher that their chosen career won&#39;t even exist by the time they graduate?

One question I have is how you determine domain specificity, and perhaps potential lost opportunity?<br>For example, using financial services tasks as in your example. If you ask someone working in finance about what insights they&#39;d be looking for, tax or perhaps transfer pricing may not be what they consider as part of their domain. However, transfer pricing and tax could have a huge impact on what finance should consider when taking decisions. How do you ensure the domain specificity is not too narrow?",2023-12-15T23:01:49Z

The AI model consequently would spit out gibberish or false information at best. <br>And that&#39;s the main problem with statistical models: 1) They are as good as the data that are being fed,  2) There is no actual way for any AI (statistical model) to distinguish truth/accurate from false/inaccurate data.

The new tech comes a roaring like a lion. Great work on achieving but why did Watson not do the same considering it won jeopardy more than a decade ago and project debater. Wow that was revolutionary. The transparency of all these models are datasets we choose. Maybe ensuring that all models met a strict criteria. Hence auditing I guess.  I have heard alot of concern from people and tend to agree with these legitimized concerns. It should be able to do what Watson did and not produce an answer till it is ready to run. Watching the jeopardy challenge was an eye opener. Based on percentage an answer was given. Or not at all. That was a good solution. Keep it up and open folks we all need to have the talk. This is new and what we lack is the experience. Sad but aging seems that way too. Just the way of the world I tend to observe. It‚Äôs time that will tell this story. Hope we can get it right.

So even things like the shift in word use frequency when ingesting the Google books corpus are problematic.  As are the attitudes towards other sexes and races, etc... In those writings.  Watson did well on the game show, but didn&#39;t do so hot at their other hopes for it.  It largely failed to make headway on biomedical problems and pharmaceuticals and was unable to generate the profit IBM had hoped it might.  The people that work in these domains understand how their data works and the potential for sophisticated models to fail in actual application, hence why linear modeling is still so common for them.  It isn&#39;t just them being Luddites or dinosaurs, it&#39;s that it isn&#39;t their rodeo.  They&#39;ve been through building sophisticated models and watching them fail to improve real diagnosis rates on new incoming patients because they have more systemic but shifting (non-stationary) differences in their mean and standard deviation, etc... that the models spuriously relied on.  I see the same thing all the time now.  It goes like this: <br>1) They gather a nice curated data set<br>2) They split into test and train<br>3) They use train to build the model, test on test and results are great, seems like it generalizes to test data.  They say, &quot;let&#39;s use this for real in the clinic!&quot;<br>4) They try it in the clinic and results are not necessarily awful,... but they&#39;re below the benchmark heuristic or standard measure previously in use.  The new data is messier and had systemic differences from the training/testing data, and again, these characteristics drift over time, so the longer they try to keep it going in the clinic, the worse things seem to get.  <br>5) The publish that good part from before they went to the real world use case and the real case is a failure so they don&#39;t even try to publish it.  People get more hyped and gassed up on the sophisticated new methods.  <br>6) Eventually people become disillusioned, but not until failing themselves.  In the macro scale you get things like the &quot;AI Winter.&quot;  <br><br>It&#39;s difficult to scrutinize the model data because it&#39;s so large.

Some of the comments around SPI, VPN, and (micro-)segmentaion seemed a bit off.  Looking inside the packet payload is still mostly regular packet inspection.  As you said but perhaps not forcefully enough, the stateful part is where that packet fits within a larger sequence/flow/protocol.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone else call SSH a form of VPN.  Some VPNs use SSH vs. IPSEC to make an encrypted connection from point A to B, but that seems a different concept.  I rarely hear people discussing segmentation in that sort of left-to-right from secure to private context.  I usually hear that term within one of those areas for splitting up dev, qa, and production (internal) or mail servers, dns servers, and web servers (dmz/external).

First, consider the packet filtering firewall.  It operates on the 5-tuple ( protocol, source and destination IP address, source and destination port ) in only one direction.  Thus, two rules are required to allow bi-directional traffic.  Generally, the packet filtering firewall is in the form of an Access Control List (ACL) on a physical device, and is not a physical device on its own.<br><br>The stateful firewall eliminates the single direction limitation by implementing a connection table that tracks traffic in one direction and automatically implements policy to allow the traffic to return.  Only one rule is required to allow bi-directional traffic.  This type of firewall is commonly a physical device, but can take the form of a type of ACL or software on a host ( i.e. Windows Firewall ).<br><br>Deep packet inspection is not directly related to either of the two firewall types, although it is most commonly found in stateful firewalls.  DPI simply refers to the fact that the firewall can look beyond the packet headers and into the payload, as part of the decision to allow or drop the traffic.  The effectiveness of DPI is limited by encryption.  The firewall cannot protect against what it cannot see.  This limitation is commonly overcome through the use of decryption of inbound traffic and re-encryption as the traffic leaves the firewall, which comes at a cost of higher CPU usage and added latency.",2023-11-27T03:09:47Z

There are technologies such as Redis that tend to put data in-memory (a place that is not always encrypted by default) which could be subject to memory dumps where sensitive data as well as encryption keys could be extracted from. Thankfully Intel and AMD have improved memory protection (TME and SME) in their latest processors families enabling encryption for data-in-use.,2023-07-19T12:08:20Z

Many years ago, I was a computer tech, even before there was such a thing as a &quot;PC&quot;.  I worked for a telecommunications company and most of our computers were used for message switching.  On one occasion, a TV station wanted to do a piece on our computers.  However, they didn&#39;t think the computers were doing anything, so we had to run diagnostics on the tape stands, to make them look busy.  üôÇ<br>Computers have advanced over the years.  Way back in the dark ages, computers were built for either business or science &amp; engineering.  IBM&#39;s early business computers used fixed point decimal, while the S&amp;E systems used floating point.  This also applied to computer languages, with COBOL used for business and FORTRAN for S&amp;E.  This was necessary because the computers back then were so limited, they had to be customized for the intended market.  Later, as computers became more powerful, they became general purpose.  Also, after the introduction of mini-computers and later, personal computers, the mainframes continued for high performance applications.  They also evolved from single CPU with I/O processors, to multi-CPU, just like PCs.  These days, one of my cousins, a nuclear physicist, uses a &quot;mainframe&quot;, actually a multi CPU system, running Linux, in his studies of neutrinos.<br>BTW, regarding the 3270 green screen, I used to work at IBM Canada in the late 90s, as an OS/2 product specialist.

We did have a few mainframes that ran VM, but those were &quot;minor&quot; system.  These VM systems could run tons of VM type servers, which could support tons of websites.  However, the main systems that I supported were the billing systems.  I remember that the company did toy with the idea to migrating to a distributed (many multiple smaller CPU) systems, but these systems were too slow to handle the volume of programs that were run on the mainframes to produce the bills, and this was a 24 hour/6-7 day/52 week operations billing cycles.  So the only systems powerful enough to handle this were IBM mainframes.  The company had to continuously upgrade to the latest IBM mainframes, which costs millions and millions of dollars, but that was necessary to be able to process the bills.

Mainframes are great for running monolithic Cobol/PL/1/Assembler applications using batch jobs or OLTP (CICS/IMS) against say DB2 relational databases. That stack is super efficient and the I/O optimisations in Z/OS and the hardware make it sing for those workloads. That&#39;s where you do get the 40x efficiency (seriously) and it might even make sense economically (probably not though). But modern workloads are very CPU intensive compared with Cobol and very inefficient. All that object oriented code and web service calls and XML and JSON, most of it is shunting data around memory without doing anything. But on modern machines costing peanuts, it doesn&#39;t matter, what does is the abstraction benefits of using modern software techniques. I&#39;m sure the Tellum chip is super performant and well integrated but at the end of the day a mainframe cpu core on a the same silicon process won&#39;t be that different performance wise from a cloud cpu. Sure, the MCM is highly integrated with it&#39;s 250 odd cores, but it&#39;s so much more expensive - it&#39;s irrelevant to non locked in customers.

The mainframe architecture has been around since the 1950s (that&#39;s over 70 years now), but the newest systems are completely technologically modern.    The reason for the enduring misconception of mainframes being old is far, FAR more people are familiar with PC-based Linux systems than mainframes (and it&#39;s always been that way ever since Linux came out in the early 1990 and became much more prevalent by the late 1990s).  What helps educate people about IBM&#39;s offerings is the ongoing work with zXplore and Z-Days, and Zowe in VSC.  The Linux-optimized systems need demonstrator accounts (like the LinuxONE over at Marist). to allow people to play around with the system.   The zD&amp;T system helps, but the single-user insistence for the student license is a handicap (real mainframes in the real world are never single-user, except maybe at IPL) as application development is always going to be multiuser.  It helps to IBM could enhance user training with the possibility of a PC-scale &quot;toy mainframe&quot; that anyone can have. The &quot;toy mainframe&quot; does enough of the real mainframe can do to be educational, but compared to a real mainfame it just does much less and much more slowly (because at its core it&#39;s a PC with emulators - a bit like a Linux box or Windows box running Hercules Hyperion.. And also as far as mainframes IBM has enjoyed decades of generous exposure - everyone knows what an &quot;IBM mainframe&quot; is - - Far fewer are aware of Unisys (now a subsidiary of SAIC) or Groupe Bull (France, bought GE&#39;s mainframe business a few decades ago).   Be out there, be friendly, be very available, support students and hobbyists (there are mainframe hobbyists) along with your installed base, and be friendly.  Train them to be IBM customers and maximally allow educational materials. Those people wind up in data centers debating whether to rack up  the upgrades with IBM, Dell, or HP.

You program the API with a programming language SDK.  In summary, the SDK helps you to build the API.  Now you can always use the raw elements provided by a programming language to build the API, but an SDK helps you get there faster by &quot;packaging&quot; capabilities into one subset of operations.  For instance, think of Node.JS and Express.  You can build a WebServer with paths and methods to make a REST API always.  Think of Express.js as a SDK Framework, that will help you get there faster by &quot;pre-configuring&quot; some functionality for you.

The problem is, businesses don&#39;t understand being reactive is much more expensive than being proactive. Reading the fine print and understanding the tools they put into their system and what is protected or not can make a huge difference. Taking lunch to bring in food and do a cybersecurity training with staff is basically free or the cost of the food. Making sure your employees know what to look for and know how to respond can be your biggest and least expensive act of defense.

I come from the mainframe performance monitoring area and academically I understand what observability definition is from control theory. Now I am facing all these new changes and digital transformations, specifically in the mainframe area, where I work as a Produt Manager. I am trying to learn these new concepts, but here are some observations:<br>-	The video starts by saying that APM, Monitoring, and Observability are different terms and then examines why? But you only discuss an Observavilty Solution instead<br>-	It seems that observability is primarily related to the Collection/generation of meaningful data. If this is entirely different than traditional monitoring, it is where the lines get fuzzy. Any monitoring solution (even monolithic) requires a sort of generation and collection of some kind of  data, analysis and action, so what&#39;s the difference?.<br>-	Also, when you build the 3 step process, you refer this as Observability Solution but do not explain what observability is?<br>-	 I think what is most important (please forgive me because I am learning this) is how you manage relations of the unpredictable distributed systems and applications (you mention this at the end)<br>-  Instana is the IBM observability solution, but there  is no clear distinction of the 3 terms (APM/Observability/Monitoring).<br>Thanks again, I enjoyed and learn a lot with your videos.",2021-07-13T00:31:48Z

Both provide orchestration, but Docker Swarm comes out of the box and Kubernetes doesn&#39;t, you need to set it up and maintain it; and so it does NOT make things easier :(. Docker Swarm is ideal for small container clusters. Yes, Kubernetes shines when you have thousands of containers, which is what its creators at Google built it for. But, for most run-of-the-mill apps, Docker Swarm is more than sufficient. And finally, you could have compared Kubernetes to other cloud native alternatives, like AWS ECS, Fargate, EKS, and their counterparts at Azure.",2022-12-11T09:39:35Z

These are all technologies and languages that are not suitable for large scale deployments because they are massive memory and CPU hogs (and Docker is a disk hog too).  What language <b>should</b> you be using?  PHP for most apps and C for the ultra high-performance stuff.  If you think you need Docker, then you are almost certainly doing something wrong and it starts with understanding how far removed from the hardware you are.  When you&#39;ve got multi-GHz CPUs at your disposal then you should be counting your clock cycles to figure out where all the performance is being chewed up and find suitable replacements.  Don&#39;t throw more hardware at the equation and pointlessly increase application complexity until you&#39;ve understood your actual problem.",2020-12-14T20:52:03Z

It is easily queryable and can be used for BI and report generation. But it has two disadvantages :- <br>1. The cost of data warehouse is too high <br>2.

In the first case you don&#39;t know what the value is, and in the 2nd case the actual/original data has the same value as before and the copy of it has no value.<br>- well, when it comes to have a lakehouse, the restaurant could force the supplier to dock at a special place to load ONLY vegetables or ONLY meat, so reducing the amount of &quot;labeling&quot; (obviously it has some additional costs to build different docks and certain restaurants (small ones) may not be able to afford that) so on the same way a data lake could apply some data warehouse &quot;principles&quot; to increase the structured-ness and the possibility of &quot;governance&quot;.<br>- It reminds me the sci-fi writer Stanislav Lem&#39;s novel where he describes how the wireless communication was &quot;invented&quot;: &quot;the engineers made the diameter of the wire by which the communication was done smaller... and then even smaller... and then a bit more... and at one point... there was no wire...&quot; üôÇ",2023-06-08T15:39:22Z

It&#39;s basically a centralized place where an organization stores all their different data, allowing for many types of analytics at a larger scale (e.g social media data).<br>While a data pipeline is a system that filters these large amounts of data in order to provide a more concise and insightful set of analytics to the organization.

In the first case you don&#39;t know what the value is, and in the 2nd case the actual/original data has the same value as before and the copy of it has no value.<br>- well, when it comes to have a lakehouse, the restaurant could force the supplier to dock at a special place to load ONLY vegetables or ONLY meat, so reducing the amount of &quot;labeling&quot; (obviously it has some additional costs to build different docks and certain restaurants (small ones) may not be able to afford that) so on the same way a data lake could apply some data warehouse &quot;principles&quot; to increase the structured-ness and the possibility of &quot;governance&quot;.<br>- It reminds me the sci-fi writer Stanislav Lem&#39;s novel where he describes how the wireless communication was &quot;invented&quot;: &quot;the engineers made the diameter of the wire by which the communication was done smaller... and then even smaller... and then a bit more... and at one point... there was no wire...&quot; üôÇ",2023-06-08T15:39:22Z

Like now also c and cpp is used in Intel and all So how u explain the system that we love to do job for because it is system oriented. I think two years to finish pg through IBM real time job that is for our hunger.  If not u feed only rich persons and ur reputation and path that builted is not for humans.  Why means every rich and mispersons do errors and fails with full of money in mouth. Pls answer out of free courses the certification is very costly and the thing is we can&#39;t graduate along with family and work.  If so why u r so pronounce and the world technologies is waste to show ourselves.  Every person mother is watching having big servers that we don&#39;t know so please come out of your self respect and choose good person to join may next birth is a good person who lives practically and help to survive the exam here.  So much energy so much waste. Nothing to do and escape from here to apart of sky for our mother who can&#39;t be thinked. So think ur way u can know who I am speaking and the time u have left or else u will doped s we go heavens or only technology is our life.  Pls see ur grandma resume and answer is this fair way to act.  Pls reply I am ur student.,2021-07-31T15:31:47Z

That may be the source of your confusion. Sorry about that! But to clarify, there&#39;s two issues at play here: (1) How do you know the message you received is actually from who you think it is?  (2) How do  you establish secure communication with someone?¬†<br><br>For (1), you as the receiver of a message from SND know that <b>must</b> have originated from SND if you&#39;re able to decrypt it with SND&#39;s public key, because only SND has their [private] key that was used to encrypt it.¬†<br><br>Let&#39;s say for (2), SND wants to establish a secure connection with RCV. To start, SND creates a unique SND-to-RCV session ID &quot;ZZZ&quot; and wants to send it to RCV. So, SND uses RCV&#39;s public key to encrypt the session ID ZZZ, encrypts that with their own (SND&#39;s) private key, then sends the &quot;package&quot; to RCV. It&#39;s true that someone <b>could</b> intercept that package and use SND&#39;s public key to decrypt it, but all that would get them was RCV&#39;s (encrypted) session ID, which is worthless to the interceptor. On the other hand, RCV can decrypt the package using SND&#39;s public key <b>and</b> they can also decrypt the message to retrieve the session ID using their private key since SND used RCV&#39;s public key to encrypt it. Once this is complete, both SND and RCV share a session ID that nobody else knows; that can be used to establish a secure connection with both parties knowing the other end is who they claim to be.<br><br>Another easier way to think of it is a message encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the associated private key. Thus you can use this asymmetry to prove that a message did in fact originate with the owner of the public/private key, because any tampering along the way would render the message gibberish when decrypted.<br><br><br>Did I get it right, @jeffcrume?",2023-02-03T21:48:52Z

The industry is working up to no less than a dozen different permutations of DevOps (GitOps, AIOps, BizDevOps...)! DevSecOps = DevOps + Security. I think of this as DevOps with a focus on security. Where DevOps initially was focused on bringing together Development and Operations, DevSecOps, emphasizes the bringing together of IT Sec/InfoSec/AppSec into the mix. It is really an extension of breaking down silos with yet another critical stakeholder in application delivery. This also means integrating security and quality activities into the pipeline process. I talk more about this integration in my blog series: <a href=""https://medium.com/ibm-garage/devsecops-58e0aa323412"">https://medium.com/ibm-garage/devsecops-58e0aa323412</a><br>Simply put, DevSecOps is a derivative of DevOps.

Conventional PCs are something that you can with have a lot of freedom and flexibility. Essentially you can do whatever you want with your PC - re-program it, install software on it, play with it... However an edge computing device is something that is more likely administered by a central service provider (i.e. Amazon Alexa offered by Amazon) that you cannot easily tamper with, but it does have enough processing power to do many things locally rather than always having to talk to the Cloud. A prime example is a self-driving car. A self-driving Tesla is an epitome an &quot;edge computer&quot; which drives your car without having talking to the Cloud - and quite conceivably so. Moreover, a Tesla self-driving car receives upgrades from Tesla every once in a while - a sign of being administered by Tesla. Last but not least, you can&#39;t re-program a Tesla to let it ignore pedestrians in front of itself otherwise it&#39;d become a really cheap assassin... Hope it helps.",2020-06-17T23:52:32Z

I try to write my question in many different forms hopefully, you may get my question. I know what is blockchain and how it works, but I just want to know what kind of data are putted into blockchain transactions, I mean why the blockchain system is used for coding data? who is the sender of data that pay miners as bitcoin for trying to solve a block? who will receive the uncoded and completed blocks as a package? are blockchains governments classified information, that they wanted to transfer, or are such blockchain transactions just people daily transactions which spread out through the blockchain system (encrypted) as a safer, faster way with a non-central server room which can not be destroyed, produce too much heat or use too much electrical power in a local area or need repeatedly upgrades? I want to know the substance of the information which are coded through math equations and blockchain, senders and receivers of the information, and why they gave credit to such a huge encryption system that needs millions of miners to guess answers block by block? (byzantine algorithm) what kind of information can be that important to be coded like this? for example: all transactions, even generated bomb codes that are changing repeatedly and every 1-2 minutes can be safely encrypted with a simple hex 64. why the blockchain system created? and who use it as a tool to solve accidental math equations. I believe it is more likely for spying purposes for some governments. imagine you forgot the code of your suitcase (2 locks), and you don&#39;t want to try all numbers from 1 to 999 for each sides, so you hire 2 networks of people to find both answers separately, as soon as the answers found, the network members will verify it separately, and you will pay them but no group can open your pandora box because they just know one code of it and only you (the owner) have access to both solved codes. I am looking for THE OWNER of blockchains data who pay the system for solving such shitty math equations.",2021-02-12T16:53:18Z

Ur private ip address is not recognized by google so ur router does the talking to the internet. It is like a cell phone which allows u to talk to <a href=""http://google.so/"">google.So</a> ur private ip address is converted into the internet ipaddress with the help of net masking which u can see on seeing ifconfig which shows that ur private ip address is converted into the routers ip address. Basically when u buy internet connection you are buying an ipaddress that can talk to the world.Ur ISP has globally bought a range of ip address from IANA and it is giving u an ipaddress. So all the devices which access internet from ur home would actually be converted into the routers ip address in ur router and those packets are shoots up into the <a href=""http://net.so/"">net.So</a> ur router does the working of a postman when it receives reply from google and internally unmask the ipaddress to determine who was the person who send that request.",2020-06-21T02:03:15Z

NOSQL predates Relational Databases by decades (1960s) and was called Hierarchical Databases. When Edgar F. Codd invented Relational Databases (early 1970s), computers weren&#39;t powerful enough to support them and it wasn&#39;t until 1979 the Oracle truly commercialized Relational Databases. Just like today Relational Databases need more computing power than the simpler NOSQL Database. This is because the main drawcard of RDBMs needs it, &quot;Data Relationships&quot;. Without the relationships that SQL provides, one has to write the joins into their own code whether it be Python, Ruby, C++ , Go etc or rely on the same or similar SQL syntax to do perform joins (Hadoop, Splunk come to mind). SQL reduced the proliferation of code needed to do joins. Imagine having downstream systems using multiple programming languages, each one having to munge their own joins. RDBMs also provide other things such as ACID, which ensures your data is in a consistent state even if there are conflicts. Frankly once the data is normalised it easier to work with SQL plus ORMs.",2023-04-17T12:18:33Z

By the late 1970s, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) had duplicated the technology.  I am not familiar with IBMs implementation so the rest of my comments will apply to DEC.<br><br>It is important to understand that the underlying storage technology is one aspect and HOW THE DATA WAS ACCESSES is totally another !  On DEC machines, there as an extra &quot;layer&quot; added between the data and the application such that the data could be accessed via the primary or SECONDARY keys or sequentially !  While the primary key had to be unique, secondary keys did NOT have to be unique !!  The biggest problem was that no &quot;high level languages&quot; (Fortran, COBOL, C) supported this concept.  &quot;Extensions&quot; were added to each to support look up by primary or secondary keys.<br><br>As mentioned, there was no &quot;standard&quot; query language.  DEC invented Datatrieve.  It was a bit quirky but it included a &quot;report writer&quot;  similar in concept to IBM RPG which was immensely popular at the time.  The basic query could be written in Datatrieve and that could be linked into another custom application.<br><br>Sadly for DEC, ISAM never caught on in large volume.  It also could not scale horizontally without a lot of additional programming.  This was probably because it required proprietary language extensions.  Building &quot;forms&quot; for data entry was a sperate product or required a lot of programming.  As the world moved to &quot;windows&quot; based applications, DEC stayed in &quot;character cell&quot; interfaces as did IBM for much too long.  Microsoft Access was one of the biggest &quot;nails in the coffin&quot; for ISAM.  IBM and DEC had proprietary relational databases, but it was too Little to late.",2023-01-25T17:05:35Z

You can split a database into multiple smaller databases but then that just leads to higher maintenance costs. You could also have one just for writes and several others as read only databases but again this would need managing with the services accessing the databases.<br><br>With non relational yes you can throw into them what you want but unless you ‚Äúlock down‚Äù a schema for the data then you can‚Äôt get consistent results as each insert is a new entry rather than an ‚Äúupsert‚Äù.<br><br>I guess each have their pros and cons but you would choose whichever is best for your end system which you would know once you‚Äôve done the correct analysis,2023-05-05T21:04:50Z

In terms of Linux whenever you attach a USB or a new hard-drive to your motherboard, once the device is detected Linux Kernel (with the help of UDEV process) exposes the device in the &#39;/dev&#39; directory. All devices in &#39;/dev&#39; or &#39;/mnt&#39; directories are block devices. This means OS will send blocks (512 bytes or 4K or 8K) data at a time to the controller of the device. On the  contrary when you have a NAS the OS will only see the Network Card. The actual disks are not directly attached to the OS. In that case OS will send a whole file (instead of byte blocks as explained before) using TCP/IP. Having said that, SAN does have network attached storage controllers but the device appears to the OS as a local device writable at block byte level.",2020-07-18T23:45:43Z

It&#39;s basically a centralized place where an organization stores all their different data, allowing for many types of analytics at a larger scale (e.g social media data).<br>While a data pipeline is a system that filters these large amounts of data in order to provide a more concise and insightful set of analytics to the organization.

In the case of block storage, the &quot;contract&quot; for multiple access/caching/locking is pretty well defined.  Filesystems, however, can vary.  Small DBs run happily anywhere.

It is equivalent to data swamps as data stroed inside also can be inaccurate, duplicate or inaccurate data which can not be used for querying or for Business Intelligence.<br>In order to use this data, Data is cleaned first and then loaded into Data Warehouse through ETL process. It is easily queryable and can be used for BI and report generation. But it has two disadvantages :- <br>1. The cost of data warehouse is too high <br>2. Apps wants to consume fresh data may not get it from Data warehouse as it ETL process takes time to load data into warehoulse. <br>Hence to solve the shortcomings of both Data Lake and Data Warehouse, concept of data lakehouse is introduced",2023-09-09T13:41:41Z

E.g. if it&#39;s not &quot;found&quot; (not labelled so nobody knows what it is) and when it is recognized that it&#39;s a duplicate of something else are not the same things. In the first case you don&#39;t know what the value is, and in the 2nd case the actual/original data has the same value as before and the copy of it has no value.<br>- well, when it comes to have a lakehouse, the restaurant could force the supplier to dock at a special place to load ONLY vegetables or ONLY meat, so reducing the amount of &quot;labeling&quot; (obviously it has some additional costs to build different docks and certain restaurants (small ones) may not be able to afford that) so on the same way a data lake could apply some data warehouse &quot;principles&quot; to increase the structured-ness and the possibility of &quot;governance&quot;.<br>- It reminds me the sci-fi writer Stanislav Lem&#39;s novel where he describes how the wireless communication was &quot;invented&quot;: &quot;the engineers made the diameter of the wire by which the communication was done smaller... and then even smaller... and then a bit more... and at one point... there was no wire...&quot; üôÇ",2023-06-08T15:39:22Z

It&#39;s in order to prevent all the load going on the Authoritative server directly and for managing purposes it is easier otherwise one admin has to look after all the things.

This request is sent across using TCP/IP. The location of the web server and the user shouldn&#39;t matter for accessing the website until and unless it is a region restricted website in which case you might require VPN. If the server is located in a geographically distant location then there might latency issues but accessibility should be fine. Although this problem is tackled by using a distributed system where website owners can setup servers at various locations.,2021-08-09T22:24:57Z

Ur private ip address is not recognized by google so ur router does the talking to the internet. It is like a cell phone which allows u to talk to <a href=""http://google.so/"">google.So</a> ur private ip address is converted into the internet ipaddress with the help of net masking which u can see on seeing ifconfig which shows that ur private ip address is converted into the routers ip address. Basically when u buy internet connection you are buying an ipaddress that can talk to the world.Ur ISP has globally bought a range of ip address from IANA and it is giving u an ipaddress. So all the devices which access internet from ur home would actually be converted into the routers ip address in ur router and those packets are shoots up into the <a href=""http://net.so/"">net.So</a> ur router does the working of a postman when it receives reply from google and internally unmask the ipaddress to determine who was the person who send that request.",2020-06-21T02:03:15Z

A CDN is basically an edge server: a &#39;content delivery network&#39; is a network of servers that are strategically located geographically to enable faster web performance, by putting copies of web content closer to the users.  <br>Each CDN server is located on what is called the &#39;network edge&#39; - closer to users than the main server where the website is originally hosted.

These services usually have a dashboard where you can upload content. This is called a push CDNs, meaning you are pushing data. Some of these services also provide APIs, so you don&#39;t have to manually open their dashboard and upload HTML, videos etc. Instead in your code, itself you can have sophisticated logic to upload and distribute newly added content across the globe.<br><br>However some of these services also have pull CDNs wherein it works like a LRU(least recently used cache). Say your first user request for HTML page, that request goes to your server and that data is cached in pull CDN. From next time, that user can directly hit pull CDN instead of making round trip to your server.<br><br><br>On the other hand, if you don&#39;t trust cloud services, then you as an owner can also create your own CDNs. Some big companies do it all on their own and maintain their own servers. Or some companies like Netflix what they do is, they partner with other CDN companies and ISPs(Internet Service Providers like Airtel, Verizon, Jio etc) and store videos etc right there. So whenever new content gets added to Netflix you don&#39;t have to to USA to get that data for example, but your ISP or some nearest CDN can give that information for you. <br><br>And for all of this data, there is usually something called TTL(Time to live). its like a expiry date. Usually in hours or days or seconds(for some dynamic content). You should be careful while setting these values coz your users might end up getting stale or old data depending on how large your TTL values are. This is also where cache invalidation becomes important. Like what strategy do you use: LRU, LFU, Random etc.",2022-01-03T23:36:36Z

However, I have a couple questions:<br><br>First question:<br>You said that one of the benefits of vRAN over RAN is it can dynamically adjust capacity according to demand -- And the way vRAN does this is by having a cluster of vDUs that can &quot;switch on and off&quot; depending on the demand, therefore increasing/decreasing capacity. However, what&#39;s stopping us to have a cluster of BBUs instead? I have read that BBUs also have proprietary software installed on them. So couldn&#39;t we just add to that proprietary software a function that can &quot;switch on and off&quot; BBUs depending on demand?<br><br>Second question:<br>In the &quot;Campus&quot; example, how was the cell tower and the vDU communicating? Was the cell tower in the school connected to the vDU directly (using fiber optic perhaps) or does the cell tower send its signals to the RU first then the RU sends it to the vDU?",2022-02-17T07:10:17Z

Yes, you could have a cluster of proprietary, expensive BBUs, if you‚Äôre willing to accept that they‚Äôre idle most of the time. Your idea of installing BBU software functionality on hardware is essentially a vDU, the key difference is that vDU hardware is general purpose off-the-shelf servers that cost less than proprietary hardware and the VNFs are standards-based functionality versus closed, proprietary software.<br><br>A2). The vDUs are typically installed at the foot of the cell tower and directly connected to the RU, though the VDUs could be shared by multiple towers IF they‚Äôre in close proximity to serve a small region (e.g., in our fictitious example, the campus and possibility nearby businesses/residences).  Ideally, the VDUs are connected to the core network via fiber optic (backhaul), but if that‚Äôs too costly due to existing roads/buildings, radio transmission can be used.<br><br>[And thanks to our IBM UK expert on telecoms, Alan Sullivan, for verifying the accuracy of my response above]",2022-02-17T17:20:18Z

For any IT system, there are many different ways to allocate functionality to deployable units - ie there is a sliding scale from one company-wide monolith to a handful of larger systems to many smaller systems to truly function-level components. Each different level of granularity has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal solution is likely to differ by business area - ie the optimal solution for a large system can well be a mix of components of different granularity. Very few large companies have a single monolith, and I doubt many companies use 100% fine-grained services either. Fine-grained components have some important advantages, but also some very nasty disadvantages. Moderate-grained components can potentially support elastic scaling without needing to be &quot;single functions&quot;. What is presented here are truly two extremes, and while the disadvantages of huge monoliths are presented, the (many) problems with truly fine-grained systems are not discussed at all.",2023-09-05T07:56:43Z

And frankly speaking, why do I want to bundle build platform with deployment platform?  <br><br>2) Serving - Istio Server Mesh already have everything you described.  What is the &quot;killer app&quot; you want to provide, other than trying to replace Istio?  And how do you actually replace Istio?  It has much more feature than just serving.  What do you offer that excites me to use introduce a new component, the Knative Seving, for routing and traffice splitting which have been in Istio Service Mesh?    OK, Knative has request-monitoring autoscale to zero capability.  And Kubernetes has resource-monistoring autoscaling.  Kubernetes takes longer to scale.  Fair enough.  For companies that have buget boundary, yes it the a great selling point.  But many companies don&#39;t really have microservices that just sit idles for a long period of time.  So it has a use case, but a use case that is relatively niched, if you don&#39;t have thousands of microservices or functions, and sitting idle even for a short period of time has huge financial impact.  <br><br>3) The real use case is Knative Eventing.  This capability allows any Kubernetes Cluster to hook up to an underlying event source, such as Kafka, Pulsar, Google Cloud, or many other streaming platforms.  So this is a real use case.  For this use case alone, it is worth to investigate the Knative and including it as part of your infrastructure (and the complexity it brings to the infrastructure)",2022-05-28T15:41:51Z

With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that servers are still running the code. The ‚Äúserverless‚Äù name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer.

I like the prensentation format, but i&#39;m still a little bit confused about two (probably more, haha) things. I&#39;m just learning about architectures, so excuse me, if my questions seem obvious:<br>- 1.) Let&#39;s start with the roboter vacuum cleaner. I&#39;m having trouble understanding the flow of data and corresponding actions being taken. The roboter sends an event to the event backbone (a kind of server I assume), which triggers a FaaS, which takes action &quot;with the vacuum cleaner&quot; eg. cleaning the house? How is that achieved? Does the robot have to have a connection to be able to clean? <br>-  2.) Store case: A customer triggering a checkout event, which updates the inventory seems logical. But how about responses to user specific data. E.g. denying the checkout because of an empty inventory or a payment (verification) event, which only corresponds to one specific order. Same thing can be asked about the spotify play event, which triggers the &quot;suggestions&quot; process. Who handles sending the song data to the client or the suggestions, which only apply to a users currently hearing that song.<br>I would be glad if someone could sacrifice some time and offer their insight.

Not all services start their existence at the same time.

Agile is broader than DevOps which concerns only developpers and system administration (build &amp; run). also people don&#39;t necessarily choose the cloud, many companies have on premises infra, or run a bit local and other services in a cloud. reality is much more complex and diverse than your diagram, although you have a point that infra management, software architecture and organizational principles go together.",2020-11-25T20:16:46Z

So, it&#39;s a more fully developed and ready to use solution offered to customers via a subscription model over the internet. Gmail and Salesforce would be two good SaaS examples.<br>FaaS on the other hand abstracts everything as well except the individual &quot;functions&quot;, actions, or pieces of the business logic that is managed by the customer. Outside of SaaS, FaaS has the highest level of abstraction at the smallest unit of scale which would be a function. So, with FaaS, a customer can break their application down into individual functions and upload them to a FaaS programing platform managed by a CSP where these functions will be triggered and executed when you need them. Also, FaaS is very cost effective as a customer only pays for the times that their functions get called instead of having to pay to have their application always on and waiting for requests like you would have to with PaaS.<br>I would recommend taking a look at some tutorials for our FaaS offering, IBM Cloud Functions, to learn more about FaaS üëâ <a href=""https://ibm.co/2YWwFvp"">https://ibm.co/2YWwFvp</a> <br>Hope this is helpful and thank you for your question!",2021-02-09T08:40:17Z

For any IT system, there are many different ways to allocate functionality to deployable units - ie there is a sliding scale from one company-wide monolith to a handful of larger systems to many smaller systems to truly function-level components. Each different level of granularity has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal solution is likely to differ by business area - ie the optimal solution for a large system can well be a mix of components of different granularity. Very few large companies have a single monolith, and I doubt many companies use 100% fine-grained services either. Fine-grained components have some important advantages, but also some very nasty disadvantages. Moderate-grained components can potentially support elastic scaling without needing to be &quot;single functions&quot;. What is presented here are truly two extremes, and while the disadvantages of huge monoliths are presented, the (many) problems with truly fine-grained systems are not discussed at all.",2023-09-05T07:56:43Z

What containers do (which is why it is called virtualization), is it asks the host kernel to create an interface that &quot;lies&quot; to the running process about what it is seeing as its local environment (a &quot;virtual&quot; environment one could say). <br><br>So when the process asks the kernel through system call what the heck is going on, the kernel gives it a virtual likeness of what is going on. This allows the OS to impersonate different file structures/networking/compute resources different from its actual setup (though not different kernels). Because of this, we can target a specific version of an OS and guarantee our application&#39;s local environment by virtualizing it with a container, and gives us an easy way to describe and share our target environment. Containers are not &quot;virtual OSes&quot;, they are more aptly described as &quot;virtualization of the OS environment for a group of one or more processes&quot;.",2022-08-13T00:33:40Z

All of the &quot;gains&quot; here go away with the following simple design changes on the VM service side.<br><br>1) Use one VM per physical server.   Host OS and hypervisor overhead and costs become negligible.<br>2) Host multiple node instances as processes in a single VM.  They must be written so they can run without interfering with one another, but this is not difficult. A scheduler process can route incoming work to local processes.<br><br>That done, one can efficiently use the shared VM.   It&#39;s kind of silly to compare a terrible VM-based design with a sensible container-based one -- of course the sensible design works better.  To be clear there&#39;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with using containers -- if they&#39;re right for your application, great.

I come from the mainframe performance monitoring area and academically I understand what observability definition is from control theory. Now I am facing all these new changes and digital transformations, specifically in the mainframe area, where I work as a Produt Manager. I am trying to learn these new concepts, but here are some observations:<br>-	The video starts by saying that APM, Monitoring, and Observability are different terms and then examines why? But you only discuss an Observavilty Solution instead<br>-	It seems that observability is primarily related to the Collection/generation of meaningful data. If this is entirely different than traditional monitoring, it is where the lines get fuzzy. Any monitoring solution (even monolithic) requires a sort of generation and collection of some kind of  data, analysis and action, so what&#39;s the difference?.<br>-	Also, when you build the 3 step process, you refer this as Observability Solution but do not explain what observability is?<br>-	 I think what is most important (please forgive me because I am learning this) is how you manage relations of the unpredictable distributed systems and applications (you mention this at the end)<br>-  Instana is the IBM observability solution, but there  is no clear distinction of the 3 terms (APM/Observability/Monitoring).<br>Thanks again, I enjoyed and learn a lot with your videos.",2021-07-13T00:31:48Z

However, I am still confused:  if an organization adopts that, or by its nature a team or teams already are doing continuous integration naturally, why do they need a specialized &#39;devops&#39; engineer?  To do what? To tell them how it is supposed to be done if they don&#39;t know that yet?  But teams can collaborate and just do it.  All it takes is competent tech leads talking to competent IT folks.  Why do you need a third &#39;DevOps&#39; middleman?",2022-09-15T20:59:17Z

However, the client does not need to know which node is the leader. Any request that requires consensus sent to a follower is automatically forwarded to the leader. Requests that do not require consensus (e.g., serialized reads) can be processed by any cluster member.<br><br>Source: <a href=""https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/"">https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/</a>",2020-09-08T18:53:45Z

Different Service types take advantage of different networking patterns to access the pods running on the underlying infrastructure. NodePort-based Services leverage existing IP addresses of compute nodes and are accessed via a Node-level proxy. LoadBalancer-based Services create new Load Balancer instances and handle traffic directly through the infrastructure-based LoadBalancer. <br>So the answer to the question is ‚Äúit depends on how you want to access it‚Äù. üôÇ ",2021-06-09T13:36:18Z

I like the prensentation format, but i&#39;m still a little bit confused about two (probably more, haha) things. I&#39;m just learning about architectures, so excuse me, if my questions seem obvious:<br>- 1.) Let&#39;s start with the roboter vacuum cleaner. I&#39;m having trouble understanding the flow of data and corresponding actions being taken. The roboter sends an event to the event backbone (a kind of server I assume), which triggers a FaaS, which takes action &quot;with the vacuum cleaner&quot; eg. cleaning the house? How is that achieved? Does the robot have to have a connection to be able to clean? <br>-  2.) Store case: A customer triggering a checkout event, which updates the inventory seems logical. But how about responses to user specific data. E.g. denying the checkout because of an empty inventory or a payment (verification) event, which only corresponds to one specific order. Same thing can be asked about the spotify play event, which triggers the &quot;suggestions&quot; process. Who handles sending the song data to the client or the suggestions, which only apply to a users currently hearing that song.<br>I would be glad if someone could sacrifice some time and offer their insight.

I still can&#39;t understand what makes you sacrifice all those loops and conditionals if a programming language in favor of very dubious advantages of declarative description AND re-implement loops and conditionals in an especially awkward way, like &#39;count&#39; in TF. After all, all that &#39;declarativeness&#39; is just visibility that hides a normal imperative approach. &#39;Programming&#39; in YAML/HCL/JSON/whatever is much more difficult than using a DSL to write idempotent scripts without sacrificing anything. The Chef approach is superior to that of Ansible and TF, IMHO.<br>As for TF&#39;s ability to destroy resources by simply deleting them from a module, it&#39;s provided by storing all actions in the state file, not by TF being allegedly declarative, I think. If Ansible or Chef saved their earlier actions, they would be able to roll them back",2021-06-10T19:14:41Z

I find the ‚Äútraining‚Äù delivered here beneficial for specific use cases but not so good for anyone who has the intention to master the subject.  After an overview of the subject is presented, then a few examples are fine. Then this can be followed up by further refinement of the design objects if appropriate. Is the purpose of a Chatbot to emulate human conversationist skills and possibly take the outcome from a specific conversation for a further related action? That was what I inferred at the higher level.  Sounds like an expansion of ‚ÄúExpert Systems‚Äù functionality from some time ago by adding a language processor and an actor to initiate further actions.  Clearly, this is my knee jerk reaction.

You program a chatbot to do certain things that humans do repeatedly, like picking up the phone and telling your customers what times you open, what you have in your inventory for sale, what time you close, etc.<br>Your customer calls on the phone, and the chat bot that you preprogrammed, answers these simple questions about when you open, when you close, what you are selling, etc. The chatbot does this for you, so you can use your time to concentrate on other things in your business.
