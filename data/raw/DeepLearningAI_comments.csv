Let&#39;s say they&#39;re not -- that would mean we have a model that, given an input, produces multiple predicted outputs ---&gt; In other words multiple y-hats. However, a function by definition must have one output. <br><br>If we put the line or curve produced by the function on a graph, there&#39;s a simple test called the Straight Line Test that confirms whether we call that &quot;line&quot; a function of x. If you can find a location anywhere on the graph where you could draw a vertical line that intersects with the function&#39;s line more than once, then the function &quot;fails&quot; the test and is not considered a traditional function. <br><br>Put another way, we call the function a &quot;function of x&quot; because x is the variable that determines the result of the function. The output of the function, conversely, is something determined by x. <b>*So a univariate regression model is a model that has one input variable and one output variable.*</b><br><br>This might sound confusing, so let&#39;s use the house-price example from the video:<br>- each of the marks on the graph (the things shaped like a tilted &quot;+&quot; sign) represent a house of &quot;x&quot; square feet that we <b>know</b> was sold for &quot;y&quot; dollars<br>- we have more houses we want to sell --&gt; BUT while we <b>do</b> know the square feet of each of these houses to be sold...<br>  - we <b>don&#39;t</b> know how much they would sell for, since they haven&#39;t been sold yet<br>- to predict how much the house <b>might</b> sell for, we&#39;ll use some clever math that predicts the sale-price based off of how much those aforementioned &quot;known&quot; houses <b>did</b> sell for<br>- that math results in a formula that predicts the house price based on its square feet --&gt; when plotted on a graph, the output of this formula would draw a straight line<br>- that formula is called a function<br><br>- NOW, let&#39;s say we have a 1300-square-foot house we want to sell<br>- if we put 1300 into the formula, we&#39;d get a certain output, a prediction of how much the house would sell for --&gt; in this case let&#39;s just say the formula output was $100,000<br>- but what if the formula <b>also</b> produced an output of $200,000<br>- which house price is right? could we sell the house for $200,000? That&#39;s a lot more money, but if the prediction was supposed to be $100,000, then nobody will buy this overpriced house when other similar-sized houses are being sold for way less<br>- Thusly, a function with multiple outputs wouldn&#39;t be very useful, because of this ambiguity<br>- So again, the function <b>has</b> to have only one output, and univariate regressions must also have only one input<br><br>However, KEEP THIS IN MIND:<br>- what happens if we have sample data with the same x but different y?<br>- in other words, what does it mean if we <b>know</b> that a 1200 square foot house was sold for $60,000, but ANOTHER 1200 square foot house was sold for $80,000 --&gt; that&#39;s two different outputs, two different y&#39;s; what does this mean?<br>- Nothing has changed, our function still works and will still make predictions based off of all the sample data<br>- This is because the sample data itself is <b>not</b> a function - they&#39;re just individual entities that we use to train our function<br><br>This will make more sense once the math is explained in the videos. <br>Hope this helps.",2023-09-28T17:45:40Z

We are drawing a line between a dataset with two (or more) supervised variables, and we want to minimize error such that we have a function that predicts future unsupervised output. Meaning --- how can we get price and square footage to relate to one another such that if we get new sq footage, we can predict a future price that is probably pretty accurate.

Also, we mimic everything like hell, it looks like from this AI sh*t we all start to feel and act like we have Aspergers. Maybe more bulletproof we would be, but then we need medication from depression (or too many emotions, especially when we&#39;re very young). More problems than people getting electrocuted. How about we take a step back and start carefully progressing instead of this rush: everyone for themselves including theories and manipulation in humankind. Also, we have roles, if not for them we wouldn&#39;t exist. Now this AI is political, which is another topic which is a conflict of our consumer interest. <br>But I guess AI is a way better salesman than us. Manipulation is good for us until something goes off the rail. Then there are people we hide stuff from because they&#39;re on a different tier of social status (personal things does exist).

Eventually unsupervised, reinforced learning will also tell us how we think - the details of feature detection, information integration, transfer of &quot;perspectives&quot;, etc - as reflections of human neural architecture (providing, for example, insight into why we use a host of neurotransmitters).   Then things will really get interesting when machines reveal to us the specific nature of cognitive limits humans have developed through the forces of evolution.

AI implementation is most prevalent in marketing, which is a form of a parasitic activity in economy, which is not adding anything to the table, but simply makes you sell your products more efficiently than competitors. New electricity would be new form of energy or new resource. Funneling virtual money from one pocket to another is none of that. I would consider AI a new  electricity when it is implemented in proper, autonomous robotics that genuinely makes utilization of resources more efficient or replaces labor. However, as he admitted, AI is not yet capable of autonomy outside virtual environment, like games. I think self driving cars will be first to get there, but we are still far from that. The danger of companies like Google is that they in fact slow down true AI development in favor of data gathering. The capital that could be used in tech is dedicated and aimed at selling stuff and marketing, which is not productive, but a burden on actual productivity. Just think about gaming: 3/4 of the budgets of game development is marketing. Imagine what could be developed in terms of quality, when marketing didn&#39;t consume so much of a budget?

In pytorch for the faster r-cnn framework with torchvision you can input a shape of any size, and the GeneralTransform module will rescale it to a fixed min and max size. Convolution operations do not require a certain spatial size as input, although you will see in Tensorflow that they often have checks for the input shape size that do restrict the shape of the image, however this is not necessary in my opinion. The ROI pool operation from the Faster R-CNN architecture gives you a fixed size tensor no matter what your input shape is (assuming it has 3 channels as in an RGB image of course).",2021-02-16T21:16:06Z

When we apply the 2nd set of convolution 16 filters - do we not apply this filter on the 6 channels we produced in the  previous layer?  Therefore the final output after the 2nd pooling should be  5X5 X 16filters X 6 filters  = 400x6=2400 ?,2018-09-10T14:11:47Z

Every filter should be visualized as a 3d matrix , i.e. a volume.  Each layer in the volume operates on each of the channels. E.g. In case of R,G,B picture, the first layer of filters would have 3 matrices each , 1 matrix for R, 1 matrix for G, 1 matrixfor B.   The 3 matrices in a single filter would operate on the R,G,B image to produce a single 2d matrix. Now 6 filters in the first layer produce 6 two dimensional matrices. Think of the count 6 as a picture with 6 channels. Therefore in the subsequent filter layers, your input picture is made up of 6 two dimensional matrices.  Each of the 16 filters in the second filter layer have a depth of 6 in the 3 rd dimension, i.e. a stack of 6 two dimensional matrices. Therefore 16 of these 6 channeled filters operate on the input image (which can be thought of as a 6 channel image produced by convolution in the first layer).",2018-09-23T10:13:55Z

Then the network is free to gradually adapt itself (hopefully by reducing train-set overfit and generalizing) as to push that layer into being evermore so of an identity one. Then if that layer manages to be an identity, it can be permanently shutdown.<br>This could be a way to reduce the network size, and maybe could automatically be applied on high variance with low bias.<br><br>As far as linear Z functions go, one way for a layer to be an identity is if it has the same amount of nodes as inputs, and if you make a cost for each node[j] so that only their weight[j] is 1 while all other weights are 0, so this would be similar to a &quot;identity&quot; Z layer. But I think that trying to make the activation function also an identity is a hassle, but even ignoring the activation function, if you could still manage to just shutdown the Z function nodes and stack the posterior activation back into the previous activation, that would already be a network simplification.<br><br>Edit: We also could try to simplify the activation functions if we generalize them and re-parametrize them. Eg. for a ReLU activation function, we could turn it into a leaky ReLU where the leaky-side parameter starts at zero (so it&#39;s just like  normal ReLU), then we add a cost of that parameter being zero and we let backprop start pushing it towards 1, in which case that previously ReLU activation has turned into the identity activation, which can them be gracefully shutdown.",2023-09-06T10:31:46Z

I am not sure why Andrew Ng didn&#39;t touch up on this. Basically once you add the skip connection you are including an additive term inside the non-linearity. The additive term can only increase the function space (the range of the function <a href=""https://www.intmath.com/functions-and-graphs/2a-domain-and-range.php)"">https://www.intmath.com/functions-and-graphs/2a-domain-and-range.php)</a> as it is &lt;&lt;nested&gt;&gt; inside the original function (the theory of nesting functions). Hence, you allow the network to have more approximating/predictive capacity in each layer.

What you&#39;re doing is using this fixed function, in this first part of the neural network, to take this input any image X and compute some feature vector for it and then you&#39;re training a shallow softmax model from this feature vector to make a prediction. One step that could help your computation as you just precompute that layers activation, for all the examples in training sets and save them to disk and then just train the softmax clause right on top of that. The advantage of the save to disk or the pre-compute method or the save to disk is that you don&#39;t need to recompute those activations every time you take a epoch or take a post through a training set.

How does the feature vector stack in final FC layer spit out some arbitrary 4 number that are bbox parameters even before backpropagation and L2 loss part. Are these initial bbox co-ordinates the one of the feature vector that has the object in it? Lets say in the case of localizing a car the final FC layer before softmax will have learnt high level features like car wheels, windshield etc and at the end these are stacked. Having said the bbox of the whole car will be different than the bbox of high level features like wheel, windshield etc. I am confused in this part of predicting the initial bbox of the whole car even though it might not be accurate initially bathos does the bbox of high level feature vector match the bbox of whole object. correct me if i were wrong somewhere.",2020-07-12T16:02:49Z

In other word distance between (3-5)^2 = (5-3)^2 are same because we took square. In Machine Learning, we want to compute the gradient (1st order derivative) of this function for minimising the loss. For that purpose, we square the loss function and then minimize it. Also we can consider absolute value but first order derivative of absolute value at 0 does not exist. Hence even though abs(loss) is continuous, it is still not differentiable at 0. Hence Square is easier to differentiate and also it will square the error and. choose a model which minimizes the larger errors more than smaller errors.

It gives nonzero results for a range of 19x1 segment (5/2 + 14 + 5/2). <br><br>Of course, adapting what we have learned to 1D conv, you are correct - but it&#39;s far, very far, from universal. <br>Thank you for understanding :-) <br><br>* this has been a source for trouble for me, coming from DSP to CV - the &quot;valid&quot; conv operation is just not natural to me",2018-07-25T09:40:12Z

In Deep learning models, features are selected automatically through the iterative process wherein the model learns the features by going deep into the dataset and selects the features to be modeled. In the traditional models the features of the dataset needs to be specified in advance.

And I have a very good principle for helping people keep at it. Which is, either your intuitions are good or they&#39;re not. If your intuitions are good, you should follow them and you will eventually be successful. If your intuitions are not good, it doesn&#39;t matter what you do.<br><br>#3 - Never stop programming!<br><br>#4 - I think one should reach enough to start building intuitions and then trust your intuitions and go for it.

Then I think of the visualizations of the filters in the convolution layers. And I do not understand how images of cats, have similar structures to images of cells/tissue/bones in radiology. I can imagine that a network which is trained on lots of pictures of pebbles could help pre-training for images of cell tissue, because of the somewhat similar circular/elliptical structure. Could you comment on this?<br><br>Another thing I am confused about is that you mention you could only retrain the last layer. Typically in a convnet this is a dense layer. Does that mean that there are cases in which no convolution layers are retrained, yet the network is effective in predicting types of images it have never seen, by just retraining the dense layer?<br><br><br>Thanks for the video, much appreciated!",2020-03-12T09:31:39Z

The problem is that, whenever either bias or variance are too high, reducing one of them often means increasing the other. This is the tradeoff. One advantage of deep learning is that you have very simple approaches in which this tradeoff does not happen, or rather is not that bad.

Layer by layer we perform forward prop, but we stop at every layer to apply our dropout filter, once it is applied to the previous layer we go to the next layer and compute the activations with those units turned off, we then apply the filter to the current layer and do the same steps for all hidden layers . If we did this without the scaling what would have happened ? Some of the signal would be lost completely meaning that the output would be reduced.  We have to understand that regularization is not designed to impact the forward prop, but rather back prop, and the propagation of the error through the weights. The fact that some units are deactivated will make the error propagation prioritize different weights at different training examples. If we trace it back to L2 regularization we force that regularization and prioritization of weights to happen similarly for all training examples, in dropout we mix it a bit more. Another way of looking at it is that if we didn&#39;t scale our  activation&#39;s we would be probably increasing the magnitude of error for that training example, which is not what we want, we are after the same error, but propagated differently so that some parameters get decreased, and thus we have a simpler hypothesis.",2019-10-31T11:40:29Z

Isn’t it really only RMS prop (or the RMS prop component of Adam), not momentum, that helps solve the plateau problem?  Momentum only solves problem of gradient swinging back and forth (overshooting) between positive and negative, which is not a plateau situation.<br>   On further reflection, maybe momentum can help a bit with plateau problem, as well, in some situations. Where one is not overshooting, but moving very slowly down plateau with declining gradients, momentum’s averaging current small gradient with prior larger gradients yields faster move down plateau.  So momentum helps a bit, though not nearly as much as RMS prop, which specifically boosts effective learning rate where the gradients are small.  <br>    Am I getting this right?",2022-02-04T03:07:19Z

Autodiff is the chain rule applied to computational graphs, which describe a computation in terms of operational primitives. For example, if my function is f(x, y) = xy + x^2, I can describe this as a computational graph. If r1 = x*y, r2 = x*x, and r3 = r1 + r2, then the derivatives of these operations are all primitive derivatives. I know that dr1/dx = y, dr2/dx = 2x, dr3/dr1 = 1 and dr3/dr2 = 1. So, if I wanted to know df/dx, then using the chain rule I would need to compute dr3/dr1*dr1/dx + dr3/dr2*dr2/dx, which is equal to 1*y + 1*2x. Now you have the derivatives in terms of values that you will get on the forward pass. <br><br>The only thing that needs to be programmed is the derivative rule for a primitive operation (addition, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logs, trig functions).

You can use the chain rule to figure this out. So, the first step is to figure out the difference in L with respect to z. To figure this out, you calculate the derivative of the function L = -(ylog a).... after you figure this out, you calculate the derivative of z with respect to w1. In this case, the the derivative is simply x1. After simplifying both derivatives, the end result is you have the derivative of L with respect to w1. This is what you use to carry out the gradient descent. So you use the newly calculated dW1 and calculate a new w1 (ie newW1 = oldW1 - (learning rate Alpha * dW1)).

Let&#39;s take two weights w1 = -0.2 and w2 = 0.5, and a linear function like lets say f(x) = 3x+0.2. Then f(w1) = -0.4 and f(w2) = 1.7. This function preserves the difference (up to a linear factor) between the two weights (w2-w1 = 0.7, and  f(w2)-f(w1) = 3* (w2-w1)=2.1. You will always have this with linear functions, but with a function like ReLU you will not (only interesting of course if at least one of the weights are negative). Now maybe this math is just nonsense, but I think I got a point here somewhere. In a sense you cannot write old weights as a &quot;linear combination&quot; of new weights.",2019-04-04T07:48:52Z
