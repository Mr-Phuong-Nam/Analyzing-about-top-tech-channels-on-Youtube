I am, however, somewhat unsure, of how deep/sophisticated these projects should be. I think the main difficulty is gathering enough industry knowledge to build a motivated, self-consistent, and self-contained project. For example, I am interested in the energy sector and I have a project in mind, where I would try to predict how the energy grid could be optimized. However, without specific data and input from the professionals in the industry, the project would hardly yield something useful. I wonder how people approach this.",2023-08-29T18:20:47Z

This tutorial should cover key aspects, including the creation of schemas, establishing relationships between schema elements, data transformation into numerical values, and the implementation of advanced search capabilities.<br><br>Schema Creation:<br><br>Commence by creating a well-structured schema to accurately represent your domain. This involves the careful identification of fundamental concepts, such as &quot;Users&quot; and &quot;Responses.&quot;<br><br>Conceptualization: Begin by meticulously defining the core concepts within your domain that warrant representation in the schema.<br><br>Class Definition: Employ Weaviate&#39;s schema definition language to create distinct classes that serve as the building blocks for your data model. For example, you may define classes like &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Response.&quot;<br><br>Property Specification: For each class, meticulously define its properties, clearly specifying their respective data types (e.g., text, numerical, date). A &quot;User&quot; class, for instance, may have properties like &quot;name&quot; and &quot;response.&quot;<br><br>Relationships:<br><br>Establishing meaningful relationships between classes is a crucial component of schema design.<br><br>Interlinking Classes: Use the &quot;hasInverse&quot; property to establish relationships between classes. For instance, you can create a relationship between &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Response&quot; by defining &quot;Response&quot; to have an inverse relationship to &quot;User.&quot;<br><br>Multi-Step Relationships: Weaviate supports complex relationships, allowing you to model intricate connections between schema elements.<br><br>Please proceed with this in-depth tutorial to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Weaviate can empower your data management and retrieval tasks.",2023-11-03T05:42:42Z

I use Chat GPT all the time, it failed much worse than I am used to. It failed so badly that I ended up having to re-write so much of the article I had copied and pasted from its answer before hitting publish, that I might have been able to write it from scratch in the same amount of time. And saving time was the only reason I tried to have Chat GPT write it for me in the first place.<br><br>But, hey, maybe that was just bad luck, so today, I thought &quot;Wait, I have an idea, why don&#39;t I use the formula and tell it to give me feedback and suggested new content on that article I published yesterday!&quot; Because the version published was quite scant on explanation still, and it failed again, but MUCH WORSE this time. It just started suggesting random paragraphs about any topic imaginable. The first time I burst out laughing. So I git regenerate, same thing.

Dr. Constance Dierickx&#39;s insights on the nexus between data and leadership are both enlightening and actionable. From &quot;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23152"">#152</a> How Data can Enable Effective Leadership with Dr. Constance Dierickx, The Decision Doctor&quot;, my top three takeaways are:<br><br>1. Data-Driven Decisions: Leaders should leverage data to make informed decisions. It not only adds a layer of objectivity but also ensures choices are rooted in evidence rather than mere intuition.<br><br>2. Empathy and Understanding: While data is crucial, the human element can&#39;t be ignored. Effective leadership merges hard data with an understanding of team dynamics, motivations, and concerns.<br><br>3.  Continuous Learning: The field of data is always evolving. Leaders should foster a culture of continuous learning and curiosity to stay ahead and make the most of the data at their disposal.<br><br>Dr. Dierickx, your perspective as The Decision Doctor brings a fresh lens to leadership in the data age.

The approach posits 3 main points<br><br>Making an impact is the objective function of all life forms n so the objective function of AGI is to maximise impact. Living thing have more impact potential than non-living things and highly intelligent beings haveeven more potential for impact. ANything we do is a kind of impact whether is self-preservation, procreation, meme propogation, DDAO and other derived objectives, and so maximising impact is what an AGI system should do.<br>Impact maximization can happen this way – If an agent relaxes(suspends output action) while perceiving something impactful and action when it perceives a lack of impact/novelity/interesting thing, so as to bring about a change in the environment, it will be more efficient in maximising impact compared to a dumb agent acting randomly. Also,Impact is a very subjective concept: what is impact for one may not be for someone else, what is impactful today for you may not be so tomorrow. hence we cant have a solid mathematical framework for impact based on a measure of activity or entropy or anything else. hebbian rule automatically results in impact maximising behaviour as, when presented with the same input again and again (usually associated with a lack of activity or impact) the same pathways get excited leading to quicker flow of activation to the o/p region whereas hen something new is perceived, activation travels through a newer pathway and hence takes longer to go to output therefore temporarily suspending o/p action. So conversely, its is not an impactful input that makes the system relax, but what makes the system relax is what is considered impactful for the system at that moment and vice versa.<br>emergence of various modules and useful and complex intelligent information processing and behavior, in a large neural network using just a variation of the hebbian rule for synaptic weight updation in addition with formulas/rules for learning rate, threshold,activation loss, neurogenesis and death updation. People talk about evolution and forming of regions taking millions of years and so we would need the same tim3efrme for this pproach, but thats wrong on 2 accounts. a) we can start with 30 billion neurons and 150 trillion synapses on day 1 ( which didnt happen in nature) and on day 1 its an impact maximising system with just hebbian rule. b) the formation of different region via evolution is not an accidental change that got permanent, the regions were shaped by biological rules such as hebbian and other homeostatic factors. So no random/accident component here thats required to form the different regions in the brain, just based on what its exposed to, the brain region can form so many different associations, representations, and other desired qualities such as remembering, abstraction, etc as demonstrated here.<br><a href=""https://superintelligencetoken.wordpress.com/2021/11/13/our-approach/"">https://superintelligencetoken.wordpress.com/2021/11/13/our-approach/</a>",2022-07-19T07:24:42Z

I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience to do exactly what you have said in this post.  I have learned from you and other Youtubers  especially my mentor Michael Saylor, who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 10 to 25 BTC that no one really knows what is going to happen and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past.
